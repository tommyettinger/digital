/**
 * Trigonometric approximations for sin(), cos(), tan(), asin(), acos(), atan(), and atan2(), with variants for most
 * that allow users to trade speed for precision or vice versa. This is primarily derived from libGDX's MathUtils class.
 * Unlike MathUtils, it exposes much more of its internal data, trusting that users can know what they are doing. A key
 * difference here is that all methods have variants that treat angles as radians, as degrees, and as turns. That is,
 * while a full rotation around a circle is {@code 2.0 * PI} radians, it is 360.0 degrees, and it is 1.0 turns.
 * <br>
 * This contains four fairly-sizeable lookup tables for some methods (in total RAM usage, just over 384KB); two store
 * 16385 results of sin() (one as float, one as double) and the other two store 16385 results of cos() (as float and as
 * double). Yes, I know they are the same data, just offset from each other or as a different type; some of the methods
 * here run so briefly that getting the index with offset nearly doubled the time taken by the method. Here,
 * {@link #sin(float)}, {@link #cos(float)}, {@link #sinSmoother(float)}, {@link #cosSmoother(float)}, and
 * {@link #tanSmoother(float)} use the LUTs. Other methods here use techniques ranging from basic Taylor series to Pad√©
 * approximants. The lookup-table-based sin() and cos() can be extraordinarily fast if the 64KB table can stay in a
 * processor cache, while the "smooth" approximations may have decent quality but perform less quickly compared to an
 * in-cache lookup table. Also available now are "precise" versions of all methods here, from {@link #sinPrecise(float)}
 * to {@link #atan2Deg360Precise(double, double)}. The "precise" versions all avoid a lookup table entirely and tend to
 * be the most precise approximations here, while still outperforming {@link Math} versions of their function. In a few
 * cases, the "precise" versions are also the fastest; this occurs most often for tan or atan2 variants, or situations
 * where a large lookup table is not possible for the processor to cache.
 * <br>
 * Relative to MathUtils in libGDX, the main new functionalities are the variants that take or
 * return measurements in turns, the now-available {@link #SIN_TABLE}, {@link #COS_TABLE}, {@link #SIN_TABLE_D}, and
 * {@link #COS_TABLE_D}, plus double variants in general. Using the sin or cos table directly has other uses mentioned
 * in its docs (in particular, uniform random unit vectors).
 * Because using a lookup table for {@link #sin(float)} and {@link #cos(float)} has very small "jumps" between
 * what it returns for smoothly increasing inputs, it may be unsuitable for some usage, such as calculating tan(), or
 * some statistical code. TrigTools provides sinSmooth(), cosSmooth(), and degree/turn variants of those for when the
 * precision should be moderately high, but it is most important to have a smoothly-curving graph of returns. A
 * different smooth approximation is used for tan(), though it is not very precise or fast compared to
 * {@link #tanSmoother(float)}, and is much less precise than the also-non-tabular {@link #tanPrecise(float)}. In
 * addition to the "xyzSmooth()" methods, there are also "smoother" variants: {@link #sinSmoother(float)},
 * {@link #cosSmoother(float)}, {@link #tanSmoother(float)}, degree/turn variants on those, and double variants on all
 * of these. {@link #sinSmoother(float)} and {@link #cosSmoother(float)} get the table indices for rounding up from the
 * given angle and for rounding down, and interpolate between the two in {@link #COS_TABLE} (or {@link #COS_TABLE_D}).
 * Unlike {@link #sinSmoother(float)} and friends, {@link #tanSmoother(float)} uses both {@link #SIN_TABLE} and
 * {@link #COS_TABLE}, does interpolation like what {@link #sinSmoother(float)} does for both sine and cosine, and
 * divides to get the tangent. The "smoother" methods are all quite precise compared to the others here, and aren't
 * necessarily slower than the "smooth" methods -- see below. Nothing here beats the "precise" methods on accuracy; they
 * often have single-digit ULP differences <em>in their worst cases</em> from what Math returns. These methods tend to
 * be slower than other approximations here but are still always faster than Math's methods (on at least Java 23).
 * <br>
 * For sine and cosine, {@link #sin(float)} and {@link #cos(float)} are extremely fast in benchmarks, but benchmarks
 * typically will have the {@link #COS_TABLE} in cache; if that table is not in cache, then they probably don't perform
 * as well. You can get somewhat improved accuracy at the cost of reduced speed ("reduced" assumes the table is
 * in-cache) by using {@link #sinSmooth(float)} and {@link #cosSmooth(float)}; these should perform the same regardless
 * of whether the table is in cache, so they may even have an edge over sin() and cos() if the table isn't.
 * Accuracy improves even further if you use {@link #sinSmoother(float)} and {@link #cosSmoother(float)}, but these are
 * definitely slower than sin() and cos(), since they do more work. Benchmarks gave conflicting information regarding
 * whether sinSmooth() or sinSmoother() is faster; JMH benchmarks showed sinSmooth() as always being faster, while
 * BumbleBench benchmarks showed sinSmoother() as always being faster. In both cases, the speed difference was small.
 * Like the "smooth" sin and cos, {@link #sinPrecise(float)} and {@link #cosPrecise(float)} are non-tabular, but are
 * more precise instead of less precise than {@link #sinSmoother(float)} and {@link #cosSmoother(float)}. They are
 * likely to perform slightly worse than the "smooth" variants but still better than Math's versions.
 * <br>
 * For calculating tangent, {@link #tan(float)} is somewhat faster on Java 8 (using HotSpot) and some OpenJ9 versions,
 * but {@link #tanSmoother(float)} is faster on Java 11 and up, significantly so on Java 16 and up. However, tan() does
 * not use {@link #SIN_TABLE}, while tanSmoother() does, and this may be relevant if the table is not in-cache. The
 * "precise" version, {@link #tanPrecise(float)}, is non-tabular like {@link #tan(float)}, and in cases where the lookup
 * tables are probably in processor cache, tanPrecise() takes about twice the time as tanSmoother() but has half the
 * mean and worst-case absolute error (which is good) and has better mean relative error as well.
 * <br>
 * There are inverse trigonometric methods here, too. {@link #asin(float)} and {@link #acos(float)} return results in
 * radians, and are accompanied by {@link #asinDeg(float)} for results in degrees, {@link #asinTurns(float)} for results
 * in turns, and acos versions of those as well. Like everything else here, there are "precise" variants on these, but
 * {@link #acosPrecise(float)} isn't quite as accurate as the other "precise" methods. All the "precise" asin and acos
 * methods still have substantially better absolute and relative error than the non-precise versions. We can't forget
 * about {@link #atan(float)}, of course, nor {@link #atan2(float, float)}! There are some more options for these
 * arctangent-related methods. {@link #atanUnchecked(double)} is used primarily by {@link #atan2(float, float)} and can
 * also be used when you are certain your inputs will be defined for the arctangent function (that is, not an odd
 * multiple of {@code 0.5 * Math.PI} for radians, or 90 degrees, or 0.25 turns). It is similar to
 * {@link #atanPrecise(float)} in that both don't return something meaningful when given an input that is out of the
 * domain for arctangent, but {@link #atan(float)} at least tries to give a better output, with dubious results.
 * {@link #atan2Deg360(float, float)} and its "precise" counterpart act like atan2 with results in degrees, but return
 * outputs in the range {@code [0, 360)} rather than the range of  {@link #atan2Deg(float, float)}, which is
 * {@code (-180,180]}. {@link #atan2Turns(float, float)} and its "precise" variant return results in the {@code [0, 1)}
 * range of turns, which can be often useful for angular values like the hue of a color when they must be in the 0-1
 * range, such as for passing to shaders. In this case, {@link #atan2Precise(float, float)} can be faster than the
 * "non-precise" variant, but this depends quite a bit on your circumstances. All atan2() code here avoids lookup
 * tables, but the "precise" versions also avoid casting between float and double. This speed advantage is countered by
 * the branching the "precise" version does; if branch prediction succeeds for a long span of calls and then suddenly
 * starts mispredicting often, then HotSpot may deoptimize parts of atan2Precise(), making it much slower. This is also
 * possible for atan2(), but is harder to cause there.
 * <br>
 * In the common case where you have an angle and want to get both the sin() and cos() of that angle, you can use the
 * {@link #radiansToTableIndex(float)}, {@link #degreesToTableIndex(float)}, and/or {@link #turnsToTableIndex(float)}
 * methods to go from an angle (in radians, degrees, or turns, as appropriate) to the index in
 * {@link #SIN_TABLE the sine table} (or {@link #SIN_TABLE_D the sine table for doubles}) that corresponds to the result
 * of sin(). That index can be used both to look up the sine, with {@code SIN_TABLE[radiansToTableIndex(angle)]}, and
 * the cosine, with {@code COS_TABLE[radiansToTableIndex(angle)]}. Unlike in the example snippets, you should usually
 * just call radiansToTableIndex() once and use its result in both places.
 * <br>
 * MathUtils had its sin and cos methods created by Riven on JavaGaming.org . The versions of sin and cos here,
 * including the way the lookup table is calculated, have been updated several times by Tommy Ettinger. The asin(),
 * acos(), and atan() methods all use Taylor series approximations from the 1955 research study "Approximations for
 * Digital Computers," by RAND Corporation; though one might think such code would be obsolete over 60 years later, the
 * approximations from that study seem to have higher accuracy and speed than most attempts in later decades, often
 * those aimed at DSP usage. Even older is the basis for sinSmooth() and cosSmooth(); the versions here are updated to
 * be more precise, but are closely related to a 7th-century sine approximation by Bhaskara I. The update was given in
 * <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/a/3886664">this Stack Exchange answer by WimC</a>. From the same site,
 * <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/a/4453027">this Stack Exchange answer by Soonts</a> provided the tan()
 * method used here. The technique in the "Smoother" methods is not much different from the typical lookup table used by
 * sin() and cos(); it just linear-interpolates between two adjacent table entries. The main difference between
 * "Smoother" and the standard approximations is that the "Smoother" ones use both the floor and the ceiling of a float
 * to get indices, while the standard approximations essentially round to the nearest index. The current technique of
 * looking up in a cosine table so that we can use the absolute value of an angle (since cos(x) is the same as cos(-x))
 * is something I hadn't seen before, but I'm sure is not novel. The "precise" methods are all drawn from
 * <a href="https://github.com/jrouwe/JoltPhysics">Jolt Physics</a> and its Vector4 implementation, which is where that
 * library's trigonometry code ends up calling. Jolt uses SIMD optimization for its trigonometry and other math code,
 * which unfortunately has no cross-platform counterpart in Java at the time of writing (June 2025); the "precise"
 * methods here are mostly ports of the C++ methods with the SIMD-specific code replaced with scalar code. Jolt was
 * written by Jorrit Rouwe and is MIT-licensed; the code based on Jolt here was in turn based partly on code for the
 * Cephes library by <a href="https://www.moshier.net/">Stephen L. Moshier</a>.
