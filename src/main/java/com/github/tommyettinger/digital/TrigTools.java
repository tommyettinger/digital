/**
 * Trigonometric approximations for sin(), cos(), tan(), asin(), acos(), atan(), and atan2(), with variants for most
 * that allow users to trade speed for precision or vice versa. This is primarily derived from libGDX's MathUtils class.
 * Unlike MathUtils, it exposes much more of its internal data, trusting that users can know what they are doing. A key
 * difference here is that all methods have variants that treat angles as radians, as degrees, and as turns. That is,
 * while a full rotation around a circle is {@code 2.0 * PI} radians, it is 360.0 degrees, and it is 1.0 turns.
 * <br>
 * This uses one or two fairly-sizeable lookup tables for some methods (each takes just over 64KB); one stores 16385
 * results of sin() and the other 16385 results of cos(). Yes, I know they are the same
 * data, just offset from each other; some of the methods here run so briefly that getting the index with offset nearly
 * doubled the time taken by the method. Here, {@link #sin(float)}, {@link #cos(float)}, {@link #sinSmoother(float)},
 * {@link #cosSmoother(float)}, and {@link #tanSmoother(float)} use the LUTs. Other methods here use techniques
 * ranging from basic Taylor series to Pad√© approximants. The lookup-table-based sin() and cos() can be extraordinarily
 * fast if the 64KB table can stay in a processor cache, while the "smooth" approximations may have comparable quality
 * but perform less quickly compared to an in-cache lookup table.
 * <br>
 * Relative to MathUtils in libGDX, the main new functionalities are the variants that take or
 * return measurements in turns, the now-available {@link #SIN_TABLE}, {@link #COS_TABLE}, {@link #SIN_TABLE_D}, and
 * {@link #COS_TABLE_D}, plus double variants in general. Using the sin or cos table directly has other uses mentioned
 * in its docs (in particular, uniform random unit vectors).
 * Because using a lookup table for {@link #sin(float)} and {@link #cos(float)} has very small "jumps" between
 * what it returns for smoothly increasing inputs, it may be unsuitable for some usage, such as calculating tan(), or
 * some statistical code. TrigTools provides sinSmooth(), cosSmooth(), and degree/turn variants of those for when the
 * precision should be moderately high, but it is most important to have a smoothly-curving graph of returns. A
 * different smooth approximation is used for tan(). In addition to the "xyzSmooth()" methods, there are also "smoother"
 * variants: {@link #sinSmoother(float)}, {@link #cosSmoother(float)}, {@link #tanSmoother(float)}, degree/turn variants
 * on those, and double variants on all of these. {@link #sinSmoother(float)} and {@link #cosSmoother(float)} get the
 * table indices for rounding up from the given angle and for rounding down, and interpolate between the two in
 * {@link #COS_TABLE} (or {@link #COS_TABLE_D}). Unlike {@link #sinSmoother(float)} and friends,
 * {@link #tanSmoother(float)} uses both {@link #SIN_TABLE} and {@link #COS_TABLE}, does interpolation like what
 * {@link #sinSmoother(float)} does for both sine and cosine, and divides to get the tangent.
 * The "smoother" methods are all very precise compared to the others here, and aren't necessarily slower than the
 * "smooth" methods -- see below.
 * <br>
 * For sine and cosine, {@link #sin(float)} and {@link #cos(float)} are extremely fast in benchmarks, but benchmarks
 * typically will have the {@link #COS_TABLE} in cache; if that table is not in cache, then they probably don't perform
 * as well. You can get improved accuracy at the cost of reduced speed ("reduced" assumes the table is in-cache) by
 * using {@link #sinSmooth(float)} and {@link #cosSmooth(float)}; these should perform the same regardless of whether
 * the table is in cache, so they may even have an edge over sin() and cos() if the table isn't. Accuracy improves even
 * further if you use {@link #sinSmoother(float)} and {@link #cosSmoother(float)}, but these are definitely slower than
 * sin() and cos(), since they do more work. Benchmarks gave conflicting information regarding whether sinSmooth() or
 * sinSmoother() is faster; JMH benchmarks showed sinSmooth() as always being faster, while BumbleBench benchmarks
 * showed sinSmoother() as always being faster. In both cases, the speed difference was small.
 * <br>
 * For calculating tangent, {@link #tan(float)} is somewhat faster on Java 8 (using HotSpot) and some OpenJ9 versions,
 * but {@link #tanSmoother(float)} is faster on Java 11 and up, significantly so on Java 16 and up. However, tan() does
 * not use {@link #SIN_TABLE}, while tanSmoother() does, and this may be relevant if the table is not in-cache.
 * <br>
 * In the common case where you have an angle and want to get both the sin() and cos() of that angle, you can use the
 * {@link #radiansToTableIndex(float)}, {@link #degreesToTableIndex(float)}, and/or {@link #turnsToTableIndex(float)}
 * methods to go from an angle (in radians, degrees, or turns, as appropriate) to the index in
 * {@link #SIN_TABLE the sine table} (or {@link #SIN_TABLE_D the sine table for doubles}) that corresponds to the result
 * of sin(). That index can be used both to look up the sine, with {@code SIN_TABLE[radiansToTableIndex(angle)]}, and
 * the cosine, with {@code COS_TABLE[radiansToTableIndex(angle)]}. Unlike in the example snippets, you should usually
 * just call radiansToTableIndex() once and use its result in both places.
 * <br>
 * MathUtils had its sin and cos methods created by Riven on JavaGaming.org . The versions of sin and cos here,
 * including the way the lookup table is calculated, have been updated several times by Tommy Ettinger. The asin(),
 * acos(), and atan() methods all use Taylor series approximations from the 1955 research study "Approximations for
 * Digital Computers," by RAND Corporation; though one might think such code would be obsolete over 60 years later, the
 * approximations from that study seem to have higher accuracy and speed than most attempts in later decades, often
 * those aimed at DSP usage. Even older is the basis for sinSmooth() and cosSmooth(); the versions here are updated to
 * be more precise, but are closely related to a 7th-century sine approximation by Bhaskara I. The update was given in
 * <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/a/3886664">this Stack Exchange answer by WimC</a>. From the same site,
 * <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/a/4453027">this Stack Exchange answer by Soonts</a> provided the tan()
 * method used here. The technique in the "Smoother" methods is not much different from the typical lookup table used by
 * sin() and cos(); it just linear-interpolates between two adjacent table entries. The main difference between
 * "Smoother" and the standard approximations is that the "Smoother" ones use both the floor and the ceiling of a float
 * to get indices, while the standard approximations essentially round to the nearest index. The current technique of
 * looking up in a cosine table so that we can use the absolute value of an angle (since cos(x) is the same as cos(-x))
 * is something I hadn't seen before, but I'm sure is not novel.
