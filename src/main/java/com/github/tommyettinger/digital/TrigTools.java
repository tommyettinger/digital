/**
 * Various trigonometric approximations, using a lookup table for sin() and cos(), a non-tabular approximation for
 * sinSmooth() and cosSmooth(), a Pad√© approximant for tan(), and Taylor series for the inverses of sin(), cos(), and
 * tan(). This supplies variants for radians, degrees, and turns. This also has an atan2() approximation defined with
 * output in radians, degrees, and turns. The lookup-table-based sin() and cos() can be extraordinarily fast if the 64KB
 * table can stay in a processor cache, while the "smooth" approximations may have higher quality but perform less
 * quickly compared to an in-cache lookup table.
 * <br>
 * This is primarily derived from libGDX's MathUtils class. The main new functionalities are the variants that take or
 * return measurements in turns, the now-available {@link #SIN_TABLE} and {@link #SIN_TABLE_D}, and double variants in
 * general. Using the sin table directly has other uses mentioned in its docs (in particular, uniform random unit
 * vectors). Because using a lookup table for {@link #sin(float)} and {@link #cos(float)} very small "jumps" between
 * what it returns for smoothly increasing inputs, it may be unsuitable for some usage, such as calculating tan(), or
 * some statistical code. TrigTools provides sinSmooth(), cosSmooth(), and degree/turn variants of those for when the
 * precision should be moderately high, but it is most important to have a smoothly-curving graph of returns. A
 * different smooth approximation is used for tan(). In addition to the "xyzSmooth()" methods, there are also "smoother"
 * variants: {@link #sinSmoother(float)}, {@link #cosSmoother(float)}, {@link #tanSmoother(float)}, degree/turn variants
 * on those, and double variants on all of these. The smoother variants actually do use the same {@link #SIN_TABLE} that
 * sin() and cos() use, but they perform tiny linear interpolations between what would otherwise be sudden jumps. The
 * "smoother" methods are all very precise compared to the others here, and aren't necessarily slower than the "smooth"
 * methods -- see below.
 * <br>
 * For sine and cosine, {@link #sin(float)} and {@link #cos(float)} are extremely fast in benchmarks, but benchmarks
 * typically will have the {@link #SIN_TABLE} in cache; if that table is not in cache, then they probably don't perform
 * as well. You can get improved accuracy at the cost of reduced speed ("reduced" assumes the table is in-cache) by
 * using {@link #sinSmooth(float)} and {@link #cosSmooth(float)}; these should perform the same regardless of whether
 * the table is in cache, so they may even have an edge over sin() and cos() if the table isn't. Accuracy improves even
 * further if you use {@link #sinSmoother(float)} and {@link #cosSmoother(float)}, but these are definitely slower than
 * sin() and cos(), since they do more work. Benchmarks gave conflicting information regarding whether sinSmooth() or
 * sinSmoother() is faster; JMH benchmarks showed sinSmooth() as always being faster, while BumbleBench benchmarks
 * showed sinSmoother() as always being faster. In both cases, the speed difference was small.
 * <br>
 * For calculating tangent, {@link #tan(float)} is somewhat faster on Java 8 (using HotSpot) and some OpenJ9 versions,
 * but {@link #tanSmoother(float)} is faster on Java 11 and up, significantly so on Java 16 and up. However, tan() does
 * not use {@link #SIN_TABLE}, while tanSmoother() does, and this may be relevant if the table is not in-cache.
 * <br>
 * In the common case where you have an angle and want to get both the sin() and cos() of that angle, you can use the
 * {@link #radiansToTableIndex(float)}, {@link #degreesToTableIndex(float)}, and/or {@link #turnsToTableIndex(float)}
 * methods to go from an angle (in radians, degrees, or turns, as appropriate) to the index in
 * {@link #SIN_TABLE the sine table} (or {@link #SIN_TABLE_D the sine table for doubles}) that corresponds to the result
 * of sin(). That index can be used both to look up the sine, with {@code SIN_TABLE[radiansToTableIndex(angle)]}, and
 * the cosine, with {@code SIN_TABLE[(radiansToTableIndex(angle) + SIN_TO_COS) & TABLE_MASK]}. Unlike in the example
 * snippets, you should usually just call radiansToTableIndex() once and use its result in both places. This will give
 * the same result for sine as {@link #sin(float)}, and the same result for cosine as {@link #cos(float)}.
 * <br>
 * MathUtils had its sin and cos methods created by Riven on JavaGaming.org . The versions of sin and cos here,
 * including the way the lookup table is calculated, have been updated several times by Tommy Ettinger. The asin(),
 * acos(), and atan() methods all use Taylor series approximations from the 1955 research study "Approximations for
 * Digital Computers," by RAND Corporation; though one might think such code would be obsolete over 60 years later, the
 * approximations from that study seem to have higher accuracy and speed than most attempts in later decades, often
 * those aimed at DSP usage. Even older is the basis for sinSmooth() and cosSmooth(); the versions here are updated to
 * be more precise, but are closely related to a 7th-century sine approximation by Bhaskara I. The update was given in
 * <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/a/3886664">this Stack Exchange answer by WimC</a>. From the same site,
 * <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/a/4453027">this Stack Exchange answer by Soonts</a> provided the tan()
 * method used here. The technique in the "Smoother" methods is not much different from the typical lookup table used by
 * sin() and cos(); it just linear-interpolates between two adjacent table entries. The main difference between
 * "Smoother" and the standard approximations is that the "Smoother" ones use both the floor and the ceiling of a float
 * to get indices, while the standard approximations essentially round to the nearest index.

     * and the 1235.23266602 this returns, so for many purposes the difference won't be noticeable.
     * <br> For inputs between -1.55 to 1.55 (getting less close to half-pi), separated by 0x1p-20f, absolute error is
     * 0.00023368, relative error is -0.00000009, and the maximum error is 0.02355957 when given -1.54996467. The
     * maximum error is the difference between the correct -47.99691010 and the -47.97335052 this returns.
     * <br> While you don't have to use a dedicated method for tan(), and you can use {@code sin(x)/cos(x)},
     * approximating tan() in this way is very susceptible to error building up from any of sin(), cos() or the
     * division. Where this tan() has a maximum error in the -1.55 to 1.55 range of 0.02355957, the simpler division
     * technique on the same range has a maximum error of 1.25724030 (about 50 times worse), as well as larger absolute
     * and relative errors. Casting the double result of {@link Math#tan(double)} to float will get the highest
     * precision, but can be anywhere from 2.5x to nearly 4x slower than this, depending on JVM.
