/**
 * Provides ways to encode digits in different base systems, or radixes, and decode numbers written in those bases. This
 * includes base systems such as binary ({@link #BASE2}, using just 0 and 1), octal ({@link #BASE8}, 0 through 7),
 * decimal ({@link #BASE10}, 0 through 9), hexadecimal ({@link #BASE16}, 0-9 then A-F), and the even larger
 * hexatrigesimal ({@link #BASE36}, 0 through 9 then A-Z). Of special note are the three different approaches to
 * encoding base-64 data: {@link #BASE64} is the standard format, {@link #URI_SAFE} is the different format used when
 * encoding data for a URI (typically meant for the Internet), while {@link #SIMPLE64} is closer to the base-16 and
 * base-36 formats here, with "0" actually meaning 0 (which is not true for the other base-64 schemes). The newest Base
 * is @link #BASE86}, which is also the largest
 * base, and uses 0-9, A-Z, a-z, and then many punctuation characters. Even more bases can be created with
 * {@link #scrambledBase(Random)}, which when called creates a base-72 Base with randomized choices for digits;
 * this could be useful for obfuscating plain-text saved data so the average player can't read it.
 * <br>
 * Each of these base systems provides a way to write bytes, shorts, ints, and longs as variable-character-count signed
 * numbers or as fixed-character-count unsigned numbers, using {@link #signed(long)} and {@link #unsigned(long)}
 * respectively. There is only one reading method for each size of number, but it is capable of reading both the signed
 * and unsigned results, and never throws an Exception (it just returns 0 if no number could be read).
 * <br>
 * Each base system can also read and write floats and doubles in several ways. Regardless of what chars a Base normally
 * uses, all can print floats and doubles in the "normal" base-10 decimal format, such as 1234543.21, as well as using
 * scientific notation, such as 1.23454e+06. The methods {@link #decimal(float)} and {@link #scientific(float)} produce
 * those formats, while {@link #general(float)} changes between format based on the scale of its argument, and the new
 * {@link #friendly(float)} uses human-friendlier decimal notation for more inputs, switching to scientific only if the
 * result would be a very long piece of text. For decimal notation, you can optionally truncate and/or pad the output
 * with {@link #decimal(float, int)}.
